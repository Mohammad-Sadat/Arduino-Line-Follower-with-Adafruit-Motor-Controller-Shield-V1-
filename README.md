A robot built with the micro-controller Arduino at the heart of the project. The robot can follow a line of darker spectrum with the help of IR sensors. The project also uses Adafruit Motor Controller Shield V1.0 to control the speed of the motors attached to the robot. The robot has been programmed in C, with the exception of the controller library, which has been programmed in C++ and has been implemented in the code.
