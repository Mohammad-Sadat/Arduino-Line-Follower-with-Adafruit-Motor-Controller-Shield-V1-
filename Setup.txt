*LFR trial Code
**REQUIREMENTS:
	1. Arduino Uno x1
	2. Adafruit Motor Shield v1 x1
	3. IR Sensors x2
	4. 9V Cell(s) x1
	5. 5v cell(s) x1
	6. DC Motors x2
	7. Jumper Wires x14
	8. Chassis x1

**PROCEDURE:
	1. Connect 5v Cell with Arduino Uno through ports 5v or Vin, and Gnd.
	2. Connect Left Sensor with Arduino through ports 3.3v, Gnd and analogue pin A0.
	3. Connect Right Sensor with Arduino through ports 3.3v, Gnd and analogue pin A3.
	4. Place the Adafruit Motor Controller Shield on the Arduino carefully.
	5. Connect 9v Cell with Motor Controller through EXT_PWR ports.
	6. Connect left motor with M4 ports.
	7. Connect right motor with M2 ports.
	8. Place the setup on the chassis.

**PRECAUTONS:
	1. The motor controller has no safety diodes with its power source ports. Be sure to know the positive and negative ends of the battery before inserting.
	2. Carefully place the motor controller on the Arduino so that the pins do not bend or break. Every Pin is Important.
	3. When setting on the chassis, place the IR Sensors 1 cm above the ground vertically.
